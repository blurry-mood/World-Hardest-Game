NOTE: Create Level button isn't implemented.

## Levels page
The game provides an infinite number of levels (Automatically generated not hand-crafted). All levels are unlocked, so you can choose any level you wish.

## Game
Depending on which you chose at the beginnning, you'll see one or two squares, one red for the player with arrows, the green one (if it exists) uses the WASD or it's controlled by the machine.
Also, there is a small red button on the top left corner, it's used to pause the game or quit it.

NOTE: If you chose the AUTOMATIC mode, you'll see some red dots on the board. However, they don't contribute to the level's outcome, they are used to help the computer move throughout the level.

## Game Outcome
This page shows the outcome of the game; whether you won or lost (though it's likely that you'll lose).
